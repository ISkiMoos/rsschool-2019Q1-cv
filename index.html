                <p>I want to offer myself as an intern.
                    I am targeting an internship at EPAM Systems for 2 reasons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        EPAM Systems is an American IT company founded in 1993.
                        The world’s largest custom software manufacturer, consulting
                        specialist, resident of the Belarusian High-Tech Park.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It will be a great advantage for me, and an honor, to work
                        side by side with the experts - to learn from practical experience,
                        to see the difficulties and solutions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The experience gained in the BelHard, Modern Front-End courses using
                    JavaScript and HTML5 - is minimal, but allows you to successfully perform
                    typical tasks: quickly, competently, responsibly, Personal qualities that
                    I use in my work: the ability to easily find a common language with colleagues,
                    build team relationships with mutual responsibility and mutual support,
                    respect for the client as an individual, the ability to communicate constructively
                    with management in terms of “need a result - this is the result”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am ready to work remotely dedicating work at least 4 hours a day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If necessary, I will be happy to come to the office once a week, at
                    a convenient time for the internship leader.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I promise the level of responsibility is the same as if I was a full-time employee.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would be happy to receive a reward for the work done, if you deem it necessary
                    to entrust me with real tasks. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, I am ready to work in exchange for experience and your
                    recommendations on the results of my work.
